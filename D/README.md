# D. SimCLR Reproduce
## Abstract
- A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5% accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50.
- When fined-tuned on only 1%  of the labels, we achieve  85.8% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100x fewer labels.
